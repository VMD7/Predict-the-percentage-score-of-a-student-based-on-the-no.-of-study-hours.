# Students Scores Prediction From Their Study Hours

This is Task1 of The Sparks Foundation GRIP. This is simple linear regression type problem.

In this repository I used linear regression algorithm to identify the score of a student from his/her study hours. 

Also, I deployed this Machine Learning model on Heroku and created a Web-App (https://sspredictor.herokuapp.com/).

## Code of Score Prediction Model

To understand this repository follow the below steps:

1) First Clone, Fork or Download this repository or you can run Task1.ipynb on Google Colab. 

2) The dataset used is (http://bit.ly/w-data).

3) Now, you can run Task1.ipynb or Task1_app.ipynb file locally or online.

4) All, the uses and instructions are written in code file itself.

### You can check the deployed App on https://sspredictor.herokuapp.com/
